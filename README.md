# ptbsDesignPatterns

Implemented Design Patterns:

Facade
Bridge
Iterator
Factory
Visitor

The UI is created and function works as follows:

A user is logged in

Main UI is generated hiding all functions behing and making simple UI - Facade
based on user title of next UI is decided - Bridge
Then user enters the productType - Factory
then iterator runs and fetches all products of that type - Iterator

then we get an option to add a trade or see availble users trading on that
then select and output is displayed on command line

visitors are present for facade, trading and classproductlist - Visitor
